# post-production-scripts
Collection of Python (compatible with Python2.7 and Python3.x) scripts for audio post-production, including batch rename, EDL management etc.
1. [correct_edl.py](#correct_edlpy)
2. [rename_mixer_files.py](#rename_mixer_filespy)
3. [tracks_to_csv.py](#tracks_to_csvpy)

## correct_edl.py
Replaces strings in `*FROM CLIP NAME` field of the EDL, accroding to the dictionary from the `.json` file. Corrected EDL is written to the new file, with `.corrected` added to the filename. Lines, starting with `*SOURCE FILE` are omitted. Main event lines are leaved unchanged.  
Example edl's are provided in `edl` folder.

#### Usage
```python correct_edl.py [--dict dict.json] [--stat] edl```  
The dictionary can be updated, just maintain the given in the example format:  
```'REPLACE_THIS.MXF': 'WITH CORRECT CLIP NAME'```
#### Options
* You can specify dictionary file with `--dict dictfilename.json` option.
* Use `--stat` option to print out all replacements.
* Path to original edl is passed after all options.

## rename_mixer_files.py
Batch rename files from format:  
``` 05-5-160928_1009.wav```  
to:  
```1009_05-5-160928.wav```  
where `1009` - recording time, `05-5` - channel number, `160928` - shooting date.  

This was done to group files by takes (recording time).  
Sample empty `.wav` files are provided in `files` folder.
#### Usage
```python rename_mixer_files.py [--rename] path_to_dir```
#### Options
* Use `--rename` option to rename files. Without this option changes are only previewed.
* Scpecify path folder with files.

It's strongly recommended to try the script without renaming, to preview what changes could be done.

## tracks_to_csv.py
This scripts converts `.txt` file, that could be exported from Pro Tools using *Export Session Info as Text* command, into `.csv` file.
This CSV file can be easily opened with Numbers.app or Excel.
#### Usage

'.csv' file

positional arguments:
