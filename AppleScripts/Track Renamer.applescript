-- AppleScripts for Avid Pro Tools.
--
-- Usage:
-- 1. Open track rename window and enter PREFIX for new track names in the "Name the track:" field.
-- 2. Run the script.
-- 3. Enter the number of tracks to rename.
--
-- Folowing tracks will be renamed to: PREFIX1, PREFIX2 ...
-- Track rename window is left open, so you can enter prefix for the next batch of tracks and run the script again.
